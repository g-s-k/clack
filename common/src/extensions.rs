/// This is then used by some Clack methods to retrieve the correct extension type from its
/// identifier.
///
/// This trait also defines how an extension pointer should be transformed to a reference to the
/// extension type. By default a simple pointer cast is done.
///
/// # Safety
/// The [`IDENTIFIER`](Extension::IDENTIFIER) **must** match the official identifier for the given
/// extension, otherwise the extension data could be misinterpreted, leading to Undefined Behavior.
///
/// By default, the implementation of the [`Extension::from_extension_ptr`] simply casts the received pointer
/// to a shared reference to the Extension type. This implies the type implementing this trait
/// must be `#[repr(C)]` and ABI-compatible with the CLAP extension struct, unless the
/// [`Extension::from_extension_ptr`] method is overridden and implemented manually.
